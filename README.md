# NeuroSite

A website that I built for a client. Utilizes NextJS, TailwindCSS, Cloudinary, SEO, EmailJS, FormDr, Google Maps API, and Vercel.

A website to display their information and setup some contact forms for them. Some features:

- Cloudinary for better image optimization (Issues with Next Image)
- Hand made SEO, contact forms, and Google Maps
- Utilized FormDr for HIPAA compliant new patient forms
