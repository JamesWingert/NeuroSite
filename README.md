# NeuroSite

A website that I built for a client. Utilizes NextJS, TailwindCSS, Docker, Cloudinary, Google Analytics, SEO, EmailJS, FormDr, Google Maps API, and Vercel. 

A basic site to display their information and setup some contact forms for them. Some features:
 - Cloudinary for better image optimization
 - Hand made SEO
 - Utilized FormDr for HIPAA compliant webforms
 - Hand made Google Maps to avoid displaying negative ratings


## Using Docker

I provided a Dockerfile to use with Docker using the example that next.js provides: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker

## Running Locally

First, run the development server:

```yarn dev```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
